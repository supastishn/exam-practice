# English Exercises Generator - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A frontend-only web application that uses OpenAI's API to generate English language exercises based on user prompts. The application will securely store API credentials as cookies and provide a comprehensive user interface for generating, displaying, and interacting with exercises.

## Features
1. **User Authentication & Setup**
   - Input form for OpenAI API key and base URL
   - Secure storage of credentials in encrypted cookies
   - Option to clear stored credentials

2. **Exercise Generation**
   - Prompt input for specifying exercise parameters
   - Exercise type selection (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, vocabulary, grammar, etc.)
   - Difficulty level selection
   - Topic/theme input
   - Language level selection (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

3. **Exercise Display**
   - Clean, readable formatting of generated exercises
   - Support for different exercise formats
   - Print-friendly version
   - Copy to clipboard functionality

4. **User Interaction**
   - Answer submission interface
   - Instant feedback on answers
   - Score tracking
   - Option to regenerate exercises
   - Exercise history

5. **Customization**
   - Theme selection (light/dark mode)
   - Font size adjustment
   - Layout options

### Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for content structure
- **CSS3**: Styling with Flexbox/Grid for layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core functionality
- **LocalStorage/Cookies**: For securely storing API credentials
- **Fetch API**: For making requests to OpenAI's API
- **CryptoJS**: For encrypting sensitive data in cookies

### Security Considerations
- Encrypt API keys before storing in cookies
- Set appropriate cookie attributes (Secure, HttpOnly where applicable)
- Never send credentials to any third-party services
- Implement session timeouts for stored credentials
- Add option to manually clear credentials

### User Experience Design
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Intuitive navigation with clear calls to action
- Loading states during API calls
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Accessibility considerations (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Progressive enhancement for broader browser support

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Structure
- Create HTML skeleton
- Set up CSS boilerplate
- Implement basic JS structure
- Create credential input and storage system

### Phase 2: API Integration
- Implement OpenAI API connection
- Create prompt templates for different exercise types
- Add handling for API responses
- Implement error handling

### Phase 3: UI Development
- Build exercise display components
- Implement theme system
- Create responsive layouts
- Add interactive elements

### Phase 4: User Interaction
- Implement answer submission

- Performance optimization

## Future Enhancements
- Exercise export functionality (PDF, Word)
- Integration with learning management systems
- Offline support with PWA features
- User accounts for persistent history (using third-party auth)
- Social sharing capabilities
